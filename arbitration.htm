                    McArthur's service as an arbitrator is based upon three
                    guiding beliefs:
                  </h3>

                  <ul class="popLetter2">
                    <li id="pL1">1</li>
                    <li id="pL2">2</li>
                    <li id="pL3">3</li>
                  </ul>
                  <ul class="layGenericList layArbitList">
                    <li>
                      First, the growth in population and economic activity in
                      the United States, set against underfunded state and
                      federal court systems, has made private dispute resolution
                      a vital part of our national justice system. Most courts
                      have too many cases to handle their dockets expeditiously.
                      The delays inherent in discovery and the duration of
                      appeals are major problems for individuals and businesses.
                      The uncertainty, delay, and cost produced by congestion in
                      the court system too often threaten the fair
                      administration of justice. It therefore is vital for
                      lawyers to create an equally fair but more rapid system of
                      alternative dispute resolution. The growing dependence of
                      U.S. companies on international trade will increase their
                      participation in international arbitration as well.

                    <li>
                      Second, arbitration has a comparative advantage because,
                      properly administered, it should reduce cost and delay.
                      Arbitrators should not have the crowded docket of the
                      average court. It is their responsibility to ensure
                      greater speed by using creative discovery procedures, and
                      they must experiment actively with flexible pretrial and
                      trial procedures. They must balance the need for fairness
                      against the requirement for efficient resolution that is
                      one of the primary reasons parties choose arbitration.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Third, it is crucial to arbitration's legitimacy that
                      speed not substitute for justice. Arbitrators must deliver
                      independent, objective justice. The deference courts
                      extend to arbitral decisions should not encourage
                      second-class decisionmaking. For arbitration to retain its
                      attractiveness, arbitrators must treat the law as just as
                      binding on them as it is on the courts. They must view the
                      limited appellate review over their decisions as a reason
                      to increase—not decrease—the care with which they decide
                      cases. Unless the parties ask to forego reasoned
                      decisions, arbitrators should provide enough explanation
                      in their decisions that the parties can see that each
                      side’s position was fairly considered. Even in cases in
                      which he is a party-selected panelist, McArthur strongly
                      prefers the parties to limit ex parte contacts after the
                      first panel meeting and to allow the panelists to decide
                      the case as fully neutral judges.
