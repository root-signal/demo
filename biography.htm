                    <span class="popLetter">J</span>ohn McArthur was appointed
                    to his first arbitration in 1994. A decade later, a major
                    utility chose him as its representative on a panel that
                    spent much of 2006 and early 2007 on a dispute over an
                    electricity supply agreement, a tolling agreement. That
                    dispute began as a billion-dollar dispute involving two
                    generating plants, and went to hearing and award as a
                    half-billion-dollar dispute involving one of those plants.
                    When McArthur established his law office in 2008, he did so,
                    in substantial part, to focus on arbitration. He has been
                    devoting most of his time to arbitration for the last dozen
                    years and today he devotes his practice to arbitration.

                    <span class="popLetter">M</span>cArthur began being admitted
                    to major arbitration lists soon after establishing his own
                    office in 2008. The American Arbitration Association made
                    McArthur a neutral in the spring of 2008 for its Large
                    Complex Case, Commercial Case, Oil and Gas, and its National
                    Energy Panel. In 2010, the International Institute for
                    Conflict Prevention and Resolution (CPR) added him as one of
                    its Distinguished Neutrals for its California and Energy,
                    Oil and Gas Panels. The next year, the Financial Industry
                    Regulatory Authority (FINRA) accepted him as a Public
                    Arbitrator. Today he is often appointed as chair of FINRA
                    panels. He is listed by the international arbitration
                    centers of Hong Kong, Dubai, and Malaysia (the AIAC), and is
                    a listed arbitrator for the London Court of International
                    Arbitration.

                    managed the Guide's Fifth Edition, published in the early
                    summer 2025. He published a treatise on awards and related

                    McArthur is frequently invited to speak and write about
                    arbitration for fellow arbitrators and for arbitration

                    <span class="popLetter">M</span>cArthur brings extensive
                    practical experience to the job of managing arbitrations—a
                    particular advantage when he serves as chair of an
                    arbitration panel—because he has prepared and tried very
                    complex cases over the years. After he joined the Houston
                    law firm Susman Godfrey & McGowan in 1983, Steve Susman
                    asked him to prepare a small payout dispute for trial. After
                    McArthur filed a counterclaim some months later, the case
                    turned into one of the largest take-or- pay cases ever
                    tried. He was one of the two lead trial counsel who secured
                    one of 1988's largest verdicts from a Houston, Texas jury (a
                    $536.2 million verdict, with settlement of $300 million plus
                    property valued at over $100 million). That case was a
                    landmark in “take-or-pay” litigation. In 2004, he was one of
                    two lead trial counsel who secured a $111 million verdict
                    from a jury in Thibodaux, Louisiana (resulting in a $60
                    million settlement) after trying one of the few oil
                    posted-price cases to go to trial. And in 2012, he presented
                    or cross-examined all witnesses as he shielded the State of
                    Alaska from a claim to reallocate roughly six million
                    barrels of oil, worth over $600 million, in administrative
                    hearings in Anchorage in 2012. (Plaintiff dismissed case
                    after losing first-level appeal).

                    often coupled with one or more business torts and issues.
                    These have included aiding and abetting, bad faith,
                    conspiracy, constructive trust, conversion, deceptive trade
                    practices, disparagement, economic loss rule, fraud,

                    at Houston's Susman Godfrey firm in 1983 when the firm

                    joint-venture arrangements, market division, refusals to
                    deal, and tying; section-two monopoly and attempted monopoly
                    claims; price discrimination; merger claims;
                    <i>Noerr-Pennington</i>; and indirect purchaser issues.
                    Involved in multiple Section One <i>per se</i> and rule of
                    reason claims and Section Two monopolization and attempted
                    monopolization claims. Antitrust experience has involved a
                    very diverse range of industries, from tennis balls to jet
                    fighters, pipelines to gasoline and fuel cell battery
                    pricing and markets.
