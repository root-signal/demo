                    <span class="popLetter">J</span>ohn McArthur was appointed
                    to his first arbitration in 1994. A decade later, a major
                    utility chose him as its representative on a panel that
                    spent much of 2006 and early 2007 on a dispute over an
                    electricity supply agreement, a tolling agreement. That
                    dispute began as a billion-dollar dispute involving two
                    generating plants, and went to hearing and award as a
                    half-billion-dollar dispute involving one of those plants.
                    When McArthur established his law office in 2008, he did so,
                    in substantial part, to handle more arbitrations--and he has
                    been arbitrating ever since.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <span class="popLetter">T</span>he American Arbitration
                    Association listed McArthur as a neutral in the spring of
                    2008 for its Large Complex Case, Commercial Case, Oil and
                    Gas, and its National Energy Panel. In 2010, the
                    International Institute for Conflict Prevention and
                    Resolution (CPR) added him as one of its Distinguished
                    Neutrals for its California and Energy, Oil and Gas Panels.
                    The next year, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
                    (FINRA) accepted him as a Public Arbitrator. More recently
                    Fed-Arb added him to a number of its panels. With a strong
                    belief in the integrity of our system of securities
                    regulation, he often chairs FINRA panels. He is listed by
                    the international arbitration centers of Hong Kong, Dubai,
                    and Malaysia (the AIAC), and is a listed arbitrator for the
                    London Court of International Arbitration.

                    published in the early summer 2025. He published a treatise

                    <span class="popLetter">M</span>cArthur is frequently
                    invited to speak and write about arbitration for fellow
                    arbitrators and for arbitration users. For a list of
                    primarily recent presentations and publications, see

                    <span class="popLetter">M</span>cArthur brings extensive
                    practical experience to the job of managing arbitrations--a
                    particular advantage when he serves as chair of an
                    arbitration panel--because he has prepared and tried very
                    complex cases over the years. Soon after joining the Houston
                    lawfirm Susman Godfrey & McGowan in 1983, Steve Susman asked
                    him to prepare a small payout dispute for trial. After
                    McArthur filed a counterclaim some months later, the case
                    turned into one of the largest take-or-pay cases ever tried.
                    He was one of the two lead trial counsel who secured one of
                    1988's largest verdicts from a Houston, Texas jury (a $536.2
                    million verdict, with settlement of $300 million plus
                    property valued at over $100 million). That case was a
                    landmark in "take-or-pay" litigation.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <span class="popLetter">I</span>n 2004, he again was one of
                    two lead trial counsel who secured a $111 million verdict
                    from a jury in Thibodaux, Louisiana (resulting in a $60
                    million settlement) after trying one of the few oil
                    posted-price cases to go to trial. And in 2012, he presented
                    or cross-examined all witnesses as he shielded the State of
                    Alaska from a claim to reallocate roughly six million
                    barrels of oil, worth over $600 million, in administrative
                    hearing in Anchorage in 2012. (plaintiff dismissed case
                    after losing first-level appeal).
